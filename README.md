# Rules
- Each player has a deck (deck has no size limit)
- Each player starts the game by choosing 5 cards from their deck
- A game board has 9 spaces. Each space can hold one card (at least 1 card will not be played)
- Each card has a Top, Bottom, Left and Right value
  - The top, bottom, left and right values are from 1 to 10
- When a card is played, it will look at all of the adjacent spaces and evaluate whether or not
its values are greater than or less than the cards occupying those spaces
